- The code to fetch the payments data has already been written
- for you below. To complete this group project, your group
- will need to write code to make this app do the following:
-
- 1.  Show the current balance based on the initial balance and
- any completed payments. Each completed payment will add to
- the balance.
- 2.  Add the payments to the table. Each payment should show
- the date of the payment, its status (whether is pending or
- complete), the description, and the amount.
-
- Pending payments should appear with a pink background.
- This can be applied by adding the `pending` class to the
- table row (`<tr>`) for each pending payment.
- 3.  Show what the balance will be after pending payments are
- completed.
- 4.  Show the total income of all payments that were received
- this month (May, 2019), including pending payments.
- 5.  Show the amount of the most valuable payment that was
- received this month (May 2019).
- 6.  For each PENDING payment, add a button that says "cancel"
- to the end of that payment's row. When the button is
- clicked, the payment should be removed from the account
- and the render function should be called again to update
- the page.
